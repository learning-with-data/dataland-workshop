          <p>
            Hi there, the walking one—I mean, the human over there. Yes, I am
            talking to you. Is it so rare seeing a penguin talking?
          </p>
          <p>
            What am I doing? Oh, just fishing by the side of this boat.
            Something that a human recently told me about. But honestly, look at
            this rod and this string. It’s pretty, um, inefficient, isn’t it?
          </p>
          <p>
            And you humans have a whole set of categories to talk about
            different kinds of fish—do you even see how random that is? Fish
            don’t just live in your categories, people. But I’m complaining too
            much. As long as that helps with your very slow way of fishing, I
            guess it’s fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mean, I also can’t always blame your category stuff anyways. One
            time, those things kind of helped me search for my cousin. I guess
            at the end they didn’t, but they did until maybe halfway… Come, let
            me tell you the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and just sit by me, over there. This fishing stuff is gonna take
            some time.
          </p>
          <p>--</p>
          <p>
            You see, I am one who loves traveling the world, and I only go back
            to my land from time to time. There lives my cousin, and he always
            welcomes me back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess it was the year of 2010, in your humans’ calendar. That year
            I went back to the land, and he wasn’t there. I asked our families,
            and no one knew where he had gone. They only told me that maybe he
            was gone before a huge snowstorm. Let me tell you, that’s not
            helping.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was so lost. I just couldn’t track him down the entire snow land.
            Well, that’s when you humans came in. Then someone told me that
            there was a group of you out there those days, following us
            everywhere, and one of you has been following my cousin. Look, I
            didn’t know what she wanted, and I didn’t judge her, but I thought
            you probably need to stop stalking us—I’m off topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            So knowing that, I thought ok, at least that stalker, she could help
            me this time. So I figured where you humans were living. I think
            it’s called <em>Palmer Station</em>. I reached out to the humans
            there, and unsurprisingly, no one knew who my cousin was. Still,
            they offered to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also turned out that, fair enough, those humans were doing some
            scientific research for pretty noble reasons (I would prefer you
            just ask us, though). And then, they offered me one of your
            categorical things—namely, datasets—and tools to help. So that’s
            when I got all of these things from them—

            I’m glad you’re still here with me, human. You humans’ fishing thing

            maybe they really couldn’t tell us penguins apart. For wWhatever
            reason, I got their records—that dataset, and later they dug out
            some more records from their boxes. With those, I started to figure

          <p>
            We got a big fish, human, and I’m not surprised that the fishing rod
            couldn’t hold. This starts to remind me of a novel that one of your
            kind wrote, the novel where someone caught a big fish in the middle
            of the ocean and lost it. It’s pretty romantic, isn’t it?
          </p>
          <p>
            But seriously, your fishing thing works so bad and now I need to get
            my fur dry—and you’d better dry that shaggy pocket that you put on
            your body, too. You humans just don’t know how to deal with the sea,
            do you?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we need to dry ourselves on the deck, why don’t we go back
            to my story? I was there with the big backpack researcher, and we
            figured out which data belonged to my cousin. You thought then we
            could just track him down, don’t you? Well, we realized that the
            researcher was stalking my cousin for her own project, and she
            didn’t keep the locations and times because she wasn’t really
            interested in those.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, we had some extra things to help. The human researchers did
            ask the penguins what names they would use to call different lands
            and places, and the humans recorded those names as “Penguin Grids”.
            To say the truth, we don’t really think of places in grids, but that
            seems to be a metaphor that works for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            And those grid names helped me as well, because the big backpack one
            also recorded those names, and we could figure out which names were
            for which places, and roughly figure out where my cousin was going.

          <p>
            From the records, we only knew the “years” according to your human
            calendars, but that was too rough. We couldn’t figure out where he
            was heading towards or which records his last locations were if we
            didn’t have more precise times.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when we had a bit more luck: that “specialized device” in the
            researcher’s backpack was part of their project measuring sea ice
            levels, and that device somehow snuggled sea ice level measurements
            and cooling and warming seasons into the dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are wondering how that’s useful, right? I have to say, on that
            part, the researcher surely outsmarted us both! It was a simple
            logic: she just assumed that the sea ice level always rose during
            the cooling season, that is, the first half of your human year, and
            it always fell during the warming season, i.e. the second half of
            the year. That way, she only needed to map the sea ice levels on my
            cousin’s records between the minimum and maximum sea ice levels of
            each year, and Voila! We knew the order of these records!
          </p>
          <p>
            Did that go too fast? Eh, I guess you have to draw it out yourself.
            Do you have paper and pencil? Oh, is everything soaked already? Duh.
            Let’s just use water to draw on the wood planks over there—

            <li>
              Find the min and max Sea Ice Level values of each year, and store
              them in variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a new column for time (we call it “Time{" "}
              {CreatePopup(popupTexts, "interpolation")}”) by using the min and
              max sea ice levels of each year.
              <ul>
                <li>When in doubt, you could use these formulae:</li>
                <li>
                  If in cooling season (first half of year):
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Time Interpolation = 0.5 * (Sea Ice Level – Min
                      Level)/(Max Level – Min Level)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If in warming season (second half of year):
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Time Interpolation = 0.5 + 0.5 * (Sea Ice Level – Max
                      Level)/(Min Level – Max Level)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember that you need to calculate this for each year
                  separately, so filter the data by year before you start
                  calculating!{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you get all the interpolated values (they should all be
                  between 0.0 and 1.0), create a new column to add these
                  fractional values to the Year (2007, 2008, or 2009).

            See how that worked? No? I know it’s a lot, human. That researcher
            was smart to come up with this plan. That way we knew how my cousin
            was moving over time, and the only thing left was to figure out
            where he was trying to go.

            It surely is cozy down here. I think we’re gonna have a windy sail
            tonight. I hope the heaters on this ship keep up, or we’ll be frozen
            by sunrise… Oh, thank you human, how nice of you. Warm drinks are
            the best. Now, if you don’t mind me adding a sardine in there…

            Ah, the warmth is making me sleepy. But I guess we should stay awake
            until we dry ourselves. Let me get back to my story. Where were we?
            Right, we were trying to figure out where my cousin wanted to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is a mysterious one, I tell you. Even I can’t always tell what
            he’s planning on, so I totally doubted if the records could help.
            But the researcher, she was totally confident in her data. I totally
            need to give her a lesson on no stalking policy, though.

            “What do you think?” She asked. I think she was waiting for a
            positive answer, but—
          </p>
          <p>
            “Human, I really can’t tell. He is such a mysterious penguin.” I
            said.
          </p>
          <p>We both sighed and sat there for a while.</p>
          <p>
            “My friend,” she said, “I’m not sure if this is helpful or if it’s
            gonna make things even worse, but I figured out a few other cases
            where my fellows were tracking individual penguins, and I asked them
            to go talk to the penguins they tracked.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I appreciate that, human. And I’m glad you listened to my lessons
            on how to talk with penguins.”
          </p>
          <p>“Shall we take a look at these stories?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know if these are gonna help but… why not?”</p>

            And so we read through them. Each of these stories is as long as the
            one I’m telling you right now, so I won’t bother telling you all of
            them, but in the end—
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah, these don’t look really good.” I said. “It’s fine, human. I
            knew several of us have gone far and tried to explore the ocean, and
            ended up lost in storms or at sea. This is not news to me. Plus, my
            families also said my cousin was probably lost in the storm. I won’t
            be surprised if he indeed was.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The researcher sat in silence, looking sad for a while, but
            eventually she stood up.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>“But I don’t want to just give up.” She said.</p>
          <p>“Well, you’re stronger than I expected. Got any plans?”</p>

            I don’t know what I can tell you, human. Honestly, those possibility
            numbers didn’t mean much to me, but in our version of the model,
            things surely looked bad. At the end, I thought we were stuck. It
            was late in the night, and both of us were exhausted. People have
            tried to search the place where my cousin last appeared, and nothing
            was found. I was making up my mind to accept that he was lost
            forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that’s when the airmails arrived at the Palmer Station. In
            there, humans found a curious postcard from, I think you called that
            place Falkland Islands. And guess what? My cousin made his bill
            print on the postcard! He has left the snow lands and gone that far,
            and till today I still have no idea how he did that. The researcher
            would say let’s pull up the ship schedules and see if he caught a
            ship just like I do. I would say thanks but I’m too tired to go
            through your records once more. But we did it anyway—we compared the
            size of the bill print with the records, and they surely matched.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, that’s my story, human. I’m glad you’ve stayed this far, and I’m
            sorry it’s kind of an anti-climax. The researcher said data analyses
            could end up with not so exciting or even confusing results. I guess
            it’s just like the slow fishing thing you humans do. Maybe you are
            aiming at a big fish, but maybe your rod breaks. Or maybe you’ll
            eventually make a smaller catch, and I guess you should still feel
            proud of it. After all it’s part of the stories we all tell, of
            ourselves, of things and fellows around us. Well, at least I am
            satisfied at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, since my feathers are dry, and so is your shaggy pocket, I
            suggest we both take a nap, and keep it warm through this windy
            night. The warm air from the heaters is so nice, and I bet tomorrow
            we will see a brilliant sunrise… Did that rhyme? O, me, a traveling
            penguin poet…
